# CNC Tutorials: Git/Github

## Intro
Welcome to the Git/Github tutorial repository! Here we will aim to demo a series of useful workflows to get started:
1. Cloning a repo
2. Creating a new branch
3. Pushing the branch, creating a pull request
4. Merging changes from another branch, dealing with merge conflicts

## Cloning a repo
If there is an existing remote repository you'd like to start development on, usually the first thing to do would be to clone that repository to your local machine. 
To obtain a local copy of any repo, go to a directory you'd like to place the repo in, and run: 
```
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
```
For this repo, the command to run locally will be: 
```
git clone https://github.com/pqz317/cnc_github_tutorial.git
```
The URL can always be found under the "Clone" Section of the Github page of the repo:
