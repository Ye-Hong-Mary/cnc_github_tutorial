# CNC Tutorials: Git/Github

## Intro
Welcome to the Git/Github tutorial repository! We will use this repo to store tutorials on Git/Github

Outside of these tutorials, there are a few other resources worth mentioning if you're interested:
- Atlassian has a series of Git tutorials: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials they're not Github-based, but concepts are the same. Their "Comparing Workflows" Section was an especially useful reference for creating these tutorials. 
- Please add any additional resources here!
